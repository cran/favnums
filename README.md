Alex Bellos ran [a poll](http://pages.bloomsbury.com/favouritenumber) to find the world's favourite number, receiving over 30,000
responses. This R package contains the dataset, formatted as a data.frame, in the hope that it will be useful for (for example) exploring analogues to the birthday problem. And just because it's fun.
